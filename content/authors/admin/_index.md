I am a PhD candadite in Political Science at the [London School of Economics and Political Science](https://www.lse.ac.uk/government). I use formal theory to study Political Economy.Â 

Using models of Political Agency and Lobbying, I consider how lobbying transparency regulations impact the behaviour of politicians and special interest groups in democratic contexts. 
In another agenda on authoritarian politics, I consider how autocrats may use informational (propaganda, censorship) and non-informational levers (repression, purges) to stay in office.
